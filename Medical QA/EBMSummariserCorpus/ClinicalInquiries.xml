				<sniptext>Patients exhibiting stroke symptoms should have brain imaging immediately within 3 hours of symptom onset.</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">based on systematic review</sor>
				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>The British National Health Service Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme published a systematic review on optimal brain imaging strategies for the diagnosis of stroke in July 2004. The HTA searched Medline and EMBASE from 1980 to 1999 and found 1903 studies relevant to diagnostic imaging for stroke. Only 25 studies reported the type of stroke diagnosed and the imaging reference standard. Thirteen of these 25 studies describe the time interval from symptom onset to imaging. The Programme advises &quot;scan all immediately&quot; for diagnosing new neurological deficits with the understanding that CT scans were most available and cost-effective.</longtext>

					<longtext>A prospective cohort study comparing imaging modalities in the acute time frame has been published. The study enrolled 129 patients with stroke symptoms of less than 3 hours, as well as 71 patients with between 3 and 6 hours of symptoms. Patients underwent multimodal MRI (including gradient recalled echo and diffusion-weighted imaging) and noncontrast CT within 90 minutes of presentation. Two stroke specialists and 2 neuroradiologists, masked to clinical information, read the scans independently at a later date. Interrater reliability was good (= 0.75-0.94) for identifying acute hemorrhage. There was 96% concordance between the MRI and CT interpretations. The 4 hemorrhages &quot;missed&quot; by CT were hemorrhagic transformations of acute infarct, and the 4 hemorrhages &quot;missed&quot; by MRI were misclassified as chronic when they were acute. The clinical implications of this study are uncertain. Without recognition of 1 imaging modality as the reference standard, it is difficult to say whether a hemorrhage &quot;missed&quot; on CT was a false negative on CT or a false positive on MRI.</longtext>

Lung cancer was diagnosed in 144 patients compared with 44 expected cases (RR=3.2; 95% CI, 2.7-3.8). Subsequently, 109 patients underwent lung resection compared with 11 expected (RR=10.0; 95% CI, 8.2-11.9). However, there was no decline in advanced cancers (42 actual vs 33 expected; P=.14) and no difference in deaths due to lung cancer (38 actual vs 38.8 expected; P=.9).

					<longtext>A 2006 study followed a cohort of at-risk patients using low-dose CT screening. There were 31,567 patients evaluated initially, of which 27,456 had an annual repeat screening. Most patients were current or former smokers (83%); patients with exposure to occupational and secondhand smoke were also included. A positive initial screen was defined as a solid or partly solid noncalcified nodule ≥5 mm in diameter; a nonsolid, noncalcified nodule ≥8 mm in diameter; or a solid endobronchial nodule. A positive screen during follow-up was defined as any new noncalcified nodule, regardless of size. Positive tests occurred in 13% of baseline screens and 5% of annual screens. Biopsies were performed according to a study protocol based on a nodule&apos;s size and behavior over time. Out of a total of 5646 positive screens, there were 535 biopsies, and a diagnosis of cancer in 492 patients.

This study randomly assigned these women with CIN1 or HPV effect to either HPV testing or colposcopic examination at 6, 12, and 18 months. Every woman under-went an exit colposcopy at 24 months.

Follow-up of these patients with repeat cytology alone at 6 and 12 months had a lower sensitivity for detection of advanced disease (85%) and greater referral rate to repeat colposcopy (60%) when compared with HPV testing at 12 months alone. Three cytologic evaluations at 6, 12, and 18 months without HPV testing increased sensitivity (95%), although this increase was not statistically significant. A much higher percentage of patients were referred to colposcopy with this strategy.

					<longtext>Obesity rates in the US have risen significantly in recent years: 30% of US adults 60 million people and 16% of children 6 to 19 years old more than 9 million, are obese, and trends suggest rates will continue to increase. Eating behaviors are learned and reinforced within families, peer groups, and other important social groups. Behavioral techniques to treat obesity attempt to reduce reinforcement for unhealthy eating behaviors and teach and reinforce healthy eating behaviors. Cue avoidance is a common behavioral intervention: the patient avoids situations in which he has overeaten in the past, such as &quot;all-you-can-eat&quot; buffets. Role play to practice restraint from overeating, or to resist social pressure to eat at an open buffet, uses cognitive therapy as a behavioral technique.

		<question>How do we decide when a patient with nonmalignant disease is eligible for hospice care?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Evidence-based guidelines for determining prognosis in some noncancer diseases have been developed. However, despite their widespread use, limited data exist to support their accuracy. Moreover, a high degree of prognostic accuracy may be unattainable given the unpredictable course of common noncancer chronic diseases. Hospice eligibility for patients with nonmalignant disease is based on clinical judgment.</sniptext>
				<sor type="B">None</sor>
				<long id="1_3">
					<longtext>A recent Clinical Inquiry addressed the issue of hospice care for patients with late-stage Alzheimer&apos;s disease. That evidence-based answer concluded that criteria superior to the NHO guidelines or clinical judgment had been established for prognosis of Alzheimer&apos;s disease. However, using those improved criteria yielded only marginally more accurate prognostication. At best, 71% of the patients predicted to live less than 6 months did so, but only if the patients had progressed through the disease in an orderly fashion. For the larger subset of patients, those who did not progress through Alzheimer&apos;s in a predictable way, only 30% of the patients actually died within 6 months.</longtext>

					<longtext>The National Hospice Organization (NHO) has created guidelines for determining prognosis in selected noncancer diseases including heart disease, pulmonary disease, dementia, HIV, liver disease, renal disease, stroke, coma, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The estimated median survival of these identified patients was 804 days. When every potential prognostic criterion was met (far more than NHO standards) only 19 of the 2607 patients qualified for hospice, and yet 10 of them were still alive at 6 months. Unlike many cancers, in which there is a steady terminal decline, diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and liver failure are characterized by a baseline of moderate functioning with intermittent-often life-threatening-exacerbations.</longtext>

		<question>Are ARBs or ACE inhibitors preferred for nephropathy in diabetes?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to reduce the progression of nephropathy in several consistent studies.

For the patients with synovial pain, intra-articular corticosteroid injection was superior to both manipulative therapy and classic physiotherapy (cure rates of 75% vs 40% and 20%, respectively, at 5 weeks), yet many primary care physicians may not have enough experience to specifically diagnose synovial pain.</longtext>

				<sniptext>Topical therapy is effective for tinea pedis. Topical terbinafine has a 70% cure rate, is available over the counter OTC, and requires only 1 to 2 weeks of therapy. Two other OTC topicals, tolnaftate and miconazole, require 2 to 4 weeks to achieve slightly lower cure rates, but are considerably less expensive.</sniptext>

					<longtext>Using data from observational postmarketing studies, investigators have extrapolated a tramadol abuse rate for the general tramadolexposed population. Ortho-McNeil, Ultram&apos;s manufacturer, funded a surveillance program that compiled tramadol abuse and withdrawal case reports from 2 sources: (1) periodic surveys for tramadol abuse case reports from a group of 255 substance abuse experts studying and caring for addiction communities, and (2) voluntary ADE case reports from health care professionals and consumers received by Ortho-McNeil. Over 3 years of surveillance, the program received 454 case reports classified as tramadol abuse. Over 5 years of surveillance, 422 cases of substance withdrawal, with primarily opioid withdrawal symptoms, were reported. There are significant threats to the validity and generalizability of the investigators&apos; estimated abuse rate of 1 to 3 cases per 100,000 tramadol-exposed patients. The abuse cases were collected in nonrepresentative samples of the tramadol-exposed population. Tramadol exposure is likely suppressed in addiction communities with access to preferred, more potent or euphoriant opioids than tramadol. Voluntary case reports of tramadol abuse significantly underestimate the actual number of abuse cases in the tramadol-exposed population. In addition, the low survey return rate (49%) further decreases the accuracy of any estimation of tramadol abuse rates.</longtext>

		<question>How should a DEXA scan be used to evaluate bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>If bone density is evaluated after initiating bisphosphonate drug therapy, it should be tested no earlier than 2 years.</sniptext>
				<sor type="B">based on case series of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scanning precision and bisphosphonate efficacy</sor>
				<long id="1_5">
					<longtext>In summary, limitations in DEXA precision mean any changes in BMD of less than 5.6% at the femoral neck may be due to measurement error, and BMD response to bisphosphonates vacillates in the first few years of use but can be expected to increase femoral neck BMD 3% to 6% over 3 years. Therefore, if serial DEXA scanning is preformed on patients prescribed bisphosphonate therapy, it should be considered no earlier than 2 to 3 years after therapy begins. When monitoring osteoporosis therapy, a BMD change within the LSC should be interpreted as &quot;no change&quot; and should not lead to changes in patient management. If the BMD has decreased beyond the LSC there is cause for concern and reevaluation of diagnosis and treatment are warranted.</longtext>

The variability in response among the 8 groups was approximately 17% (+10.4% and -6.6%) in year 1 and narrowed to a 6% difference in year 2 This regression to the mean leads to a normalization of bone density results.

					<longtext>A Cochrane review of 4 randomized controlled trials compared single doses of oxymetazoline, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. Included studies involved from 30 to 106 participants, were double-blinded and placebo-controlled, used either topical or oral decongestants for symptoms of less than 5 days&apos; duration, and measured either subjective or objective relief or adverse events. All 4 studies used nasal airway resistance as an objective measure of nasal congestion, and a combined symptom score as a subjective measure of relief. One study also administered a side-effect questionnaire. In all studies, topical and oral decongestants were equally efficacious, producing a 13% reduction in subjective symptoms and a significant decrease in nasal airway resistance after 1 dose of decongestant. Only 1 study investigated repeated doses of decongestants and found no significant additional improvement from repeated doses over a 5-day period. More studies are needed to evaluate efficacy of multiple doses. Clinical interpretation of these results must take into consideration that quality-of-life measures were not evaluated and that none of the studies included children under 12.</longtext>

Three placebo-controlled trials (N=221) showed an absolute risk reduction in death of 8% in diuretic-treated patients (number needed to treat [NNT]=12.5). Four placebo-controlled trials (N=448) showed a significantly lower rate of admissions for worsening failure among diuretic-treated patients (NNT=8.5), and 4 of the active-controlled trials (N=150) showed a nonsignificant trend toward decreased admissions. Six active-controlled studies (N=174) showed significantly increased exercise capacity for patients on diuretics. The studies used in this meta-analysis had numerous shortcomings: the individual trials had small numbers of patients (N=14-139), short follow-up periods (typically 4-8 weeks), and inadequate statistical power to clearly demonstrate morbidity/mortality reductions. There was significant heterogeneity between studies. Crossover studies were included, some studies did not clearly report masking and assessment of outcome measures, and assessment of study validity was not clear. Studies employed a variety of diuretic types and doses, used different controls, and did not clarify whether patients&apos; congestive heart failure was caused primarily by diastolic or systolic dysfunction.</longtext>

Individual CBT and ideal standard care (weekly 20- to 60-minute supportive meetings) were equally effective in reducing depression scores immediately postintervention and 6 months thereafter as measured by the EPDS (1 RCT, N=37). Although a trend toward greater benefit for CBT was noted, the study was underpowered to identify a significant difference. Nondirective counseling reduced the proportion of women with depression (N=55; RR=0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-0.95) and lowered EPDS scores (N=193; treatment effect=-2.1; 95% CI, -3.8 to -0.3; P=.02) compared with routine primary care. Individual CBT also reduced EPDS scores, when compared to routine primary care (N=55; treatment effect=-2.7; 95% CI, -4.5 to -0.9; P=.003). Psychodynamic therapy reduced the proportion of women with major depression (N=55; RR=1.89; 95% CI, 1.33-2.33).

Contraction stress testing was performed for those with nonreactive non-stress tests. To observe for macrosomia, serial ultrasonography was performed every 4 to 6 weeks, starting at 28 weeks. Forty-four patients (64%) had spontaneous labors without intervention, while the rest required induction of labor or cesarean section (primary or failed induction). Five patients had primary cesarean section for suspected macrosomia, 3 patients had intervention for suspected intrauterine growth restriction, and only 4 (5.7%) patients were delivered due to fetal indications, defined as decreased fetal movement or a nonreactive nonstress test. No stillbirths or neonatal deaths occurred. Perinatal complications included hypoglycemia (n=13; 19%), hyperbilirubinemia (n=12; 17%), and macrosomia (n=11; 16%).

		<question>How accurate is stress radionuclide imaging for diagnosis of CAD?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Stress radionuclide testing is a moderately accurate test compared with coronary angiography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in intermediate-risk individuals. Variations in technique of imaging (planar or single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) and stress (exercise or pharmacologic) do not significantly alter the accuracy of this test, although there is some evidence for decreased accuracy in women.</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">based on multiple meta-analyses</sor>
				<long id="1_5">
					<longtext>The American Heart Association/American College Cardiology AHA/ACC Task Force on Assessment of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Cardiovascular Procedures and the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology updated guidelines for cardiac radionuclide imaging in 2003. In this consensus statement a nonsystematic review of literature and expert opinion, they reported test characteristics to detect a 50% angiographic lesion as follows-exercise SPECT: sensitivity 87%, specificity 73%; vasodilator adenosine or dipyridamole SPECT: sensitivity 89%, specificity 75%. They noted that quantitative analysis performs as well as qualitative analysis of radionuclide images. Gated SPECT is slightly more specific and just as sensitive as nongated SPECT. The Taskforce recommended that radionuclide perfusion scans be performed in patients with baseline electrocardiogram ECG abnormalities such as left bundle branch block, hypertrophy, digitalis effect, etc, patients who cannot perform an exercise stress test, and to assess the functional effect of indeterminate lesions found on angiography. They also note that the repeat use of radionuclide testing 3 to 5 years after an event in asymptomatic high-risk patients and the initial use of radionuclide testing in patients at very high risk are both somewhat controversial, but the weight of limited evidence suggests some benefit to their use.</longtext>

		<question>What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>No clinical characteristic or diagnostic test is available to readily distinguish type 1 from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although C-peptide levels, autoantibodies, and adiponectin-to-leptin ratios show some utility, they do not yet have a standard diagnostic role; research on the pathophysiology of diabetes suggests that the classic type 1 and type 2 distinctions may not be appropriate for all patients1.</sniptext>
				<sor type="C">based on expert opinion</sor>
				<long id="1_7">
					<longtext>The ratio of adiponectin to leptin hormone may show diagnostic merit. Adipocytes secrete adiponectin which acts as an insulin sensitizer, antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory agent. Obesity and type 2 phenotype correlate with lower levels of adiponectin, but are associated with higher levels of leptin hormone, another molecule secreted by adipocytes. A recent case-control study of children aged 6 to 21 years analyzed adiponectin and leptin hormone levels in patients with classical type 1 and 2 diabetes, as determined by 2 pediatric endocrinologists; interestingly, 29% of the type 1 patients were autoantibody negative. After plotting a ROC curve, they found the area under the curve was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.00). At an adiponectin-to-leptin ratio cutoff less than 0.7, they found the sensitivity to diagnose type 2 was 88% (95% CI, 64-99%), the specificity was 90% (95% CI, 77-97), and the likelihood ratio for a positive test was 8.8.</longtext>

The benefits of nonsurgical treatment are significantly limited by the failure to maintain reduced body weight.

					<longtext>Serial serum TSH measurements are adequate to follow adults with newly diagnosed, uncomplicated primary hypothyroidism. However, serum thyroid hormone levels normalize before serum TSH. Serum thyroid hormone concentrations increase first, then the TSH secretion falls because of the negative feedback action of levothyroxine on the pituitary and hypothalamus. Levothyroxine has a 1-week plasma half-life; a steady state is achieved about 6 weeks (6 half-lives) after the start of treatment or a change in dose. The TSH level should, therefore, be evaluated no earlier than 6 weeks after initiating therapy or adjusting levothyroxine dosage.</longtext>

		<question>Does screening for diabetes in at-risk patients improve long-term outcomes?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>No randomized clinical trials or prospective studies have demonstrated adequate evidence to screen individuals for diabetes mellitus. A recently published meta-analysis for the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) stated that &quot;until we have better evidence about its benefits, harms, and costs, the role of screening as a strategy to reduce the burden of suffering of diabetes will remain uncertain&quot;.</sniptext>
				<sor type="B">based on inconclusive studies</sor>
				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>No randomized trials have tested whether screening provides any benefits. In a thorough systematic review using USPSTF methodologies, several potential postscreening interventions were evaluated. While tight glycemic control reduces progression of albuminuria and retinopathy, it is unclear how large the long-term clinical benefit would be, or at what cost. Reasonable evidence supports more aggressive control of blood pressure for patients with diabetes to reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes. It is important to note that the data for these interventions (aggressive blood sugar and blood pressure control) were derived in studies of patients with established diabetes; no studies have tested these interventions for patients who had early diagnosis by screening.</longtext>

				<sniptext>Tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and capsaicin reduce the pain of diabetic neuropathy; limited data suggests that lidocaine patches may also be efficacious. Both tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants are superior to placebo in relieving painful diabetic neuropathy. Compared with placebo, patients taking tricyclic antidepressants report reduced pain (number needed to treat [NNT] for at least 50% reduction= 3.5) (strength of recommendation.</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">meta-analysis</sor>
				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>A well-done meta-analysis summarized available randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants (including tricyclics and SSRIs) and anticonvulsants (including phenytoin, carbamazepine, and gabapentin). Almost all trials compare individual agents against placebo, and there have been no head-to-head trials that address functional outcomes, quality of life, patient satisfaction, or cost. Most trials do not describe diagnostic criteria, consider causes of pain other than diabetes or address diabetic control, which is known to predict frequency of neuropathy. Finally, very few trials include typical primary care patients in a primary care setting or control for important confounding variables such as over-the-counter medications or comorbid illnesses. Within the constraints of this literature, placebos have a substantial impact, with an aggregate 32% of patients receiving placebo reporting at least 50% reduction in pain. A total of 16 trials have addressed the efficacy of antidepressants for diabetic neuropathy. Compared with placebo, tricyclic antidepressants have an aggregate NNT of 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-4.7) for patients reporting at least 50% reduction of pain, along with an NNH of 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1-3.9) for minor adverse effects (typically the muscarinic effects of dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision) and 17 (95% CI, 10-43) for side effects severe enough to cause withdrawal from a trial.

The majority of the participants were white males with a mean age of 13 years. Each study showed statistically significant improvement from treatment with methylphenidate. Average effect sizes were calculated for 3 domains: ADHD symptoms (0.94), social behavior (1.06), and academic performance (1.25). Effect sizes were calculated using a modified Cohen&apos;s d, which is the difference between the treated and untreated means divided by the standard deviation in the untreated condition. It is difficult to translate these changes in effect size into clinically meaningful outcome measures, although one rule of thumb estimates an effect size of 0.8 is moderate to large. Of the 3 studies that reported the proportion of subjects with clinically significant improvement, the modal result was about one half showings improvement with methylphenidate. Of trials assessing dosing levels, &lt;50% found significant differences between &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; doses.

			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>The best way to prevent recurrent bacterial vaginosis is to treat the initial episode with the most effective regimen.

					<longtext>A meta-analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&apos;s (CDC) bacterial vaginosis working group reviewed the indications for therapy and best treatments for bacterial vaginosis. The group found 25 trials evaluating oral metronidazole therapy involving 2742 women. Although cure rates using either 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 7 days or 2 g as a single dose were similar at 2 weeks post follow-up (85%; range 67%-98%), the single-dose regimen led to higher relapse rates 1 month after treatment (35%-50% vs 20%-33%). Six trials enrolling 946 women assessed the efficacy of various topical vaginal treatments. Metronidazole gel, clindamycin cream, and clindamycin ovules had a wide range of initial cure rates (50%-95%), but all had higher relapse rates at 4 weeks than did oral metronidazole for 1 week (34%-49%).</longtext>

				<sniptext>With adults, oral theophylline may help lower the dosage of inhaled steroids needed to control chronic asthma. It offers no benefit for acute asthma exacerbations.

				<sniptext>Several small studies report some benefit from use of a hypoallergenic (protein hydrolysate) formula, maternal diet adjustment (focusing on a low-allergen diet), and reduced stimulation of the infant. While dicyclomine has been shown to be effective for colic, there are significant concerns about its safety, and the manufacturer has contraindicated its use in this population. An herbal tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel, and balm-mint was also effective in a small RCT, but the volume necessary for treatment limits its usefulness</sniptext>

					<longtext>A systematic review analyzed controlled clinical trials lasting at least 3 days involving infants less than 6 months of age who cried excessively. Twenty-seven studies were included; the outcome measure was colic symptoms, typically reported as duration of crying. Two reports studying hypoallergenic (protein hydrolysate) formula in nearly 130 infants found an effect size of 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.34) for the hypoallergenic formula. Additionally, 3 behavioral trials (involving nearly 200 infants) revealed the benefits of reduced stimulation of the colicky infant (effect size of 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-0.74).</longtext>

		<question>When should a chest x-ray be used to evaluate acute-onset productive cough for adults?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Even though the most common reason to order a chest x-ray in the evaluation of an acute-onset, productive cough is to rule out pneumonia, there is no strong evidence to help a physician decide when to order this chest x-ray. However, acute cough patients who have rhinorrhea, sore throat, respiratory rate ≤25 breaths per minute, temperature &lt;100ºF, and the absence of night sweats, myalgia, and all-day sputum production, have minimal to no risk of pneumonia and thus do not need a chest x-ray.</sniptext>

					<longtext>Almost all studies that have developed prediction rules preselected higher-risk patients-those who had already been selected to get a chest x-ray (based on unknown signs and symptoms).

				<sniptext>Diuretics that do not contain a sulfonamide group (eg, amiloride hydrochloride, eplerenone, ethacrynic acid, spironolactone, and triamterene) are safe for patients with an allergy to sulfa. The evidence is contradictory as to whether a history of allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics increases the risk of subsequent allergic reactions to commonly used sulfonamide-containing diuretics (eg, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, loop diuretics, and thiazides).</sniptext>

After reviewing the studies, the authors concluded that little evidence suggested a problem with cross-reactivity either with acetazolamide or furosemide and that there may be an association of cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and indapamide.

					<longtext>Researchers involved in a retrospective study of 363 hospital charts examined 34 patients with a self-reported history of sulfa allergy who were subsequently given acetazolamide (a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor), furosemide (a loop diuretic), or both. The nature of the self-reported sulfa allergic reaction was documented in 79% of the 34 patients. These reported reactions included urticarial rash, nonspecified rash, dyspnea, swelling, nausea or vomiting, throat swelling, red eyes, and bullae. Two patients who were given acetazolamide developed urticaria. No allergic reactions occurred for those patients given furosemide. The researchers concluded that there was little clinical or pharmacological evidence to suggest that a self-reported sulfa allergy was likely to produce a life-threatening cross-reaction with acetazolamide or furosemide.

For comparison purposes, of the 19,257 patients who were not identified as having an allergy to a sulfonamide antibiotic, again using the broad definition, 315 (1.6%), had a subsequent allergic reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2-8.4).

					<longtext>A systematic review of antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent AOM examined 9 RCTs with a total of 958 children. Recurrent AOM was defined as 3 or more episodes per 6 to 18 months.

The most commonly used antibiotics were amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, and sulfamethoxazole, given for 3 to 24 months (dosing not reported). Children taking antibiotics had 0.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.19) fewer episodes of recurrent AOM per patient-month than those taking placebo. The rate in the control group was 0.19 (95% CI, 0.13-0.26). Nine children would have to be treated per month to prevent 1 ear infection (NNT=9; 95% CI, 5-33). Only 2 of the 9 studies had statistically significant results; both used sulfisoxazole for 10 to 12 weeks and were of similar methodologic quality (12.5 out 29 points). A trend towards a better outcome in studies that used sulfisoxazole did not reach significance compared with those using other medications (ie, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole). Shorter treatment intervals (&lt;6 months) trended toward being more effective than longer intervals, but this also did not reach significance. Children with more frequent episodes of AOM did no better than those with less frequent episodes.</longtext>

				<long id="1_2">
					<longtext>In a case-control study, 29 patients were admitted to an ear, nose, and throat department with infectious mononucleosis and were evaluated serially for splenic and hepatic enlargement by ultrasound. Diagnosis was based on clinical picture, a positive heterophile test, and other blood tests. Four patients were included despite negative serology due to compelling clinical presentations and symptoms. Serial ultrasound imaging showed that all had enlarged spleens (mean enlargement 50%-60%); 50% had hepatic enlargement (5%-20% enlargement). The patients were compared with a control group of 8 patients admitted with peritonsillar abscess, as verified by tonsillectomy. No controls had hepatic or splenic enlargement. Physical examinations detected splenomegaly in only 17% of the study patients. The exams were conducted by house staff without blinding, randomization, or tests of reproducibility. Ultrasound scanning was completed on days 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 90, and 120. The spleen was significantly larger in the infectious mononucleosis group than in the control group for the first 30 days, and no difference in size was found over the subsequent 3 months. No correlation existed between laboratory values and enlargement of the spleen or liver.</longtext>

		<question>Does digoxin decrease morbidity for those in sinus rhythm with heart failure?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>In patients with congestive heart failure due to systolic dysfunction who are in normal sinus rhythm, digoxin therapy reduces rates of hospitalization, as well as clinical deterioration, defined as worsening New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification or an increase in clinical signs and symptoms</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">systematic review of randomized controlled trials [RCT]</sor>

The wide range in NNT for the reduction in clinical deterioration reflects varying baseline rates of worsening clinical status found among the 12 studies for patients receiving placebo. The narrow CI associated with the odds ratio for reduced rates of clinical deterioration reflects the fact that the majority of patients whose clinical status was evaluated as an outcome came from a single large study, the DIG trial. This trial followed 6800 patients with NYHA classifications I to III. Ninety-four percent of patients in this trial were additionally on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 82% were taking diuretics. Patients were followed for a mean of 37 months. A subgroup analysis of 988 patients with diastolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &gt;45%) in this study suggested no clear benefits or harms when digoxin was used in combination with other therapies vs placebo; however, it did show a positive trend towards the combined outcome of reduced hospitalizations and less clinical deterioration (relative risk [RR]=0.82; 95% CI, 0.63-1.07).

The 2 reviews found between 67% and 100% of patients reported pain reduction after vertebroplasty in follow-up periods ranging from 24 hours to up to 10 years.</longtext>

					<longtext>A systematic review of the most commonly used prognostic tests identified a response to a large-volume (40-50 mL) CSF tap test as having a positive predictive value (PPV) between 73% and 100% but a negative predictive value (NPV) of only 23% to 42%. Thus, observing an improvement of function after such a test is a good predictor of improvement after shunting, but many patients who do not respond to the test respond to shunting. A variation of the CSF tap test is the extended lumbar drainage test, which involves placing a lumbar intrathecal catheter and allowing the drainage of 10 mL of CSF/hour for 72 hours. The PPV for this test ranges from 80% to 100%, and NPV from 66% to 100%. A third possible test is the measurement of resistance to an infusion of saline into the lumbar subarachnoid space (CSF Ro test). This test has multiple variations of technique. Reported values for PPV are 75% to 92%, and for NPV of 27% to 92%. Other tests, such as radionuclide cisternography or magnetic resonance imaging CSF flow void, have predictive values too low or have too few studies to be recommended.</longtext>

		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Histological confirmation of infiltrative lesions via small bowel biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing celiac disease. Four serum antibody assays may serve as a first-step diagnostic tool to identify biopsy candidates: immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (IgA tTG), IgA endomysial antibody (IgA EMA), IgA antigliadin antibody (IgA AGA), and IgG antigliadin antibody (IgG AGA). IgA tTG and IgA EMA offer the best diagnostic accuracy. Patients with selective IgA deficiency may have falsely negative IgA assays.</sniptext>

			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Despite theoretical risks based on animal models given high intravenous doses, glucosamine/chondroitin (1500 mg/1200 mg daily) does not adversely affect short-term glycemic control for patients whose diabetes is well-controlled, or for those without diabetes or glucose intolerance.</sniptext>

					<longtext>A study addressed whether glucosamine taken at recommended doses for the treatment of osteoarthritis had any detrimental effect on glucose metabolism. Fourteen patients participated and had a baseline 4-hour meal tolerance test and a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, before and after 4 weeks of glucosamine sulfate treatment (500 mg orally 3 times daily). After 4 weeks they found no change in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance, or difference in insulin sensitivity in the group of subjects.7 The study was limited by a small subject number and short duration of study.</longtext>

Three-hour oral glucose tolerance tests were performed using 75 g of dextrose. These occurred before the study, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks. There were no significant differences between fasting levels of serum insulin or blood glucose. Glucosamine sulfate supplementation did not alter serum insulin or plasma glucose during the tests.

					<longtext>A systematic review of 24 RCTs (of which 13 evaluated children) showed that SABAs, mast cell stabilizers, and anticholinergics provide a significant protective effect against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction with few adverse effects (the child subgroup analyses did not differ significantly from pooled results). Mast cell stabilizers were found less effective at attenuating bronchoconstriction than SABAs, with an average maximum decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 11.9% compared with 4.6% for beta-agonists (child subgroup: weighted mean difference=7.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-10.7). Complete protection (defined in this study as maximum % decrease in FEV1 &lt;15% post-exercise) and clinical protection (50% improvement over placebo) measures were included.

		<question>What is the best diagnostic approach to paresthesias of the hand?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>There have been no good studies comparing different strategies for the evaluation of the patient with hand paresthesias. A reasonable strategy is to first evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), the most common condition associated with hand paresthesias. If the patient does not have findings consistent with CTS, then consider other diagnoses.</sniptext>
				<sor type="D">based on expert opinion</sor>
			</snip>
			<snip id="2">
				<sniptext>Findings consistent with CTS include a history of repetitive hand work, asymmetric paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve, hypoalgesia, weak thumb abduction, or latency of nerve conduction studies. Tingling in the median nerve distribution or on the entire palmar surface also supports the diagnosis. Common conditions associated with CTS are pregnancy, obesity, and hypothyroidism.</sniptext>
				<sor type="B">systematic review of case control studies</sor>
				<long id="2_1">
					<longtext>A meta-analysis of studies reviewing the precision and accuracy of the history and physical examination in the diagnosis of CTS in adults found that hypoalgesia (LR+, 3.1), classic or probable hand diagram results (LR+ 2.4, LR- 0.2), and weak thumb abduction strength (weakness of resisted movement of the thumb at right angles to the palm; LR+ 1.8, LR- 0.5) best distinguish those with and those without CTS. A classical distribution is in that of the median nerve, while a probable distribution involves the entire palmar surface. The reference standard for these studies was a nerve conduction study. Nocturnal paresthesias, Phalen and Tinel signs, and thenar atrophy had little or no diagnostic utility.</longtext>

				<sniptext>Moderate exercise reduces mortality for patients with known coronary heart disease but does not significantly decrease the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">based on systematic review of randomized controlled trials</sor>
				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>Six studies showed particularly significant improvement in total cardiac mortality. Exercise was variably defined. Training sessions lasted 30 minutes and occurred on 2 to 5 days per week. Intensity was typically 75% to 85% of a maximum work capacity determined on an exercise test before initiating the training sessions. The type of exercise ranged from cycling alone to circuit training with 6 stationary devices. Patients were trained with supervision 1 to 36 months and followed for a mean of 24 months (range, 6-60 months). A trend was observed toward decreased recurrence of nonfatal MI with exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, which did not reach significance (RR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.59-1.03). An inadequate number of subjects is the most likely reason; however, other possibilities include an increase in the frequency of nonfatal MI after rehabilitation, or an increased rate of survival after MI for patients undergoing exercise-based rehabilitation. The studies included in these reviews had several limitations. The population appears skewed in age (mean=54 years, with patients aged &gt;65 years excluded from most studies) and gender (4.9% female); ethnicity was rarely reported. The adequacy of randomization was poor or unclear in 71% of studies, and only 4 trials reported blind assessment of outcomes. Finally, in 34% of studies the loss of participants to follow-up was more than 20%.</longtext>

		<question>Should you treat a symptomatic patient by phone when his child has confirmed strep throat?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Although no studies specifically evaluate this question, treatment for Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis without laboratory confirmation in the general population is not advisable due to poor diagnostic accuracy.</sniptext>
				<sor type="C">based on consensus guidelines</sor>
				<long id="1_2">
					<longtext>According to 1 meta-analysis, a history of exposure to strep in the previous 2 weeks had a sensitivity of 19%, with a specificity ranging from 87% to 94%. This results in a likelihood ratio (LR) of 1.9 if the patient has an exposure (eg, the patient&apos;s odds of having strep are 1.9 times higher than baseline), and a patient without an exposure has an LR of 0.94. (Typically, LRs of 0.5 to 2.0 are not helpful for diagnostic testing). In a population at a 10% risk of GABHS as the cause of pharyngitis, the positive predictive value of streptococcal exposure was 17%, and the negative predictive value of no known exposure was 91%.</longtext>

					<longtext>Only 5% to 10% of adults and 20% to 25% of children presenting in an office setting with acute pharyngitis actually have GABHS pharyngitis. The prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis is higher for patients presenting to urgent care centers or emergency rooms than office practices. Of the primary clinical prediction rules for pharyngitis, only the Walsh Diagnostic Algorithm explicitly includes a history of streptococcal exposure. In that algorithm, only patients with tender or enlarged cervical lymph nodes who either had exudative pharyngitis or a recent exposure were in the highest risk category (23% prevalence of GABHS).</longtext>

When properly prescribed, antibiotics decrease communicability of GABHS to 24 hours, and symptoms by 1 day (NNT=5 patients to decrease symptoms). Antibiotics also decrease the incidence of rheumatic heart disease (NNT=100) and peritonsillar abscesses. Due to the decreased incidence of glomerulonephritis, the evidence is inadequate to determine the role of antibiotics in preventing this complication.</longtext>

				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>A Cochrane review included 38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 58 various types of interventions (some tested in factorial trials) designed to improve patient adherence to antihypertensive medications in ambulatory settings. The quality of the studies was generally low due to inadequate allocation concealment, lack of blinding of outcome assessors, loss to follow-up, and the small number of participants in trials. The authors grouped interventions into 4 broad categories: simplification of dosing regimens; patient education; patient motivation, support, and reminders; and complex interventions. Comparison groups received either no intervention, usual care, or-in the case of simplification of dosing regimens-a daily regimen consisting of more than 1 pill per day vs a once-daily regimen. Because of various types of interventions and different methods of assessing outcomes, pooling of results was, appropriately, not done. Of all the interventions, simplification of dosing regimens had the most evidence of effectiveness, with 7 out of 9 studies demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in adherence in the intervention group. In the other 2 studies, improved adherence was observed in the intervention group; however, the effect was either not statistically significant or not reported.</longtext>

					<longtext>A Cochrane review of dietary advice for reducing cardiovascular disease risk among healthy adults included 29 trials. Individuals or groups of patients received verbal or printed dietary advice over 1 or more personal contacts. They also received advice by telephone. Ten RCTs of dietary advice in 4328 participants or groups of participants assessed self-reported dietary fat intake. Overall, intake of dietary fat (expressed as a percentage of total caloric intake) fell by 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], reduced 8.4% to increased 4.0%) with dietary intervention over 6 to 48 months. Due to significant heterogeneity between the studies, this overall estimate must be viewed with caution. Eight RCT studies in 3952 participants or groups of participants assessed self-reported fruit and vegetable intake as an outcome. Overall, intake of fruits and vegetables increased by 1.2 servings per day (95% CI, 0.43-2.1) with interventions over 6 to 48 months. Again, there was significant heterogeneity between the studies. Therefore, this overall estimate must be viewed with caution. In general, the quality of the studies included in this systematic review was low due to poor descriptions of randomization, lack of allocation concealment, and lack of blinding of outcome assessment. The use of food frequency questionnaires to measure fat and fruit/vegetable intake likely led to reporting bias in these dietary intervention studies. Also, the trials were in healthy adults and not specific to hypertensive patients.</longtext>

Most patients received 21 to 40 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin per day; treatment duration was from 1 to 303 days. Arthralgia occurred in 1.5% of patients, most of whom had cystic fibrosis.

A successful outcome was defined as absence of triggering and pain, both subjectively and on examination. Follow-up examination was completed for all patients at 3 weeks and 4 months after injection. The treatment group had success outcomes for 10 of 14 patients (71%) at 3 weeks and 9 of 14 patients (64%) at 4 months, compared with 2 of 10 (20%) at both 3 weeks and 4 months in the control group (NNT=2.3; P&lt;.05 at 4 months). No significant side effects were noted. It is unclear how the study blinded the white, thick consistency of betamethasone compared with the clear nature of lidocaine alone.</longtext>

Secondary outcomes-including all cardiovascular events, cerebrovascular events, and congestive heart failure with hospitalization-also improved on 80 mg atorvastatin.

		<question>Are overweight children more likely to be overweight adults?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Yes. Overweight at any age in childhood increases the risk for overweight in adulthood. The relative risk (RR) ranges from 1.9 to 10.1 and increases as children get older. Not all overweight children become overweight adults, however.</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">systematic review of consistent prospective and retrospective cohort studies</sor>
				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>A 2008 systematic review found 25 prospective or retrospective longitudinal studies that examined the risk of overweight in adulthood based on overweight in childhood or adolescence. Studies had to include at least 1 anthropomorphic measurement before age 18 and at least 1 after age 18. The informativeness and validity of the studies were assessed using a standard evaluation tool. Because the review sought to provide results that could be generalized to large populations, it didn&apos;t include studies of specific populations, such as former premature infants. All of the 13 studies judged to be high quality found an elevated RR or odds ratio (OR) for adult obesity among participants who had been overweight as children. The authors didn&apos;t calculate a composite measure of effect, but RRs in the individual studies ranged from 1.9 to 10.1. The systematic review considered children (≤12 years) and adolescents (&gt;12 years) separately. Four high-quality studies assessed how many overweight children became overweight adults; 2 high-quality studies examined how many overweight children became obese adults. Overweight children had RRs between 1.9 and 3.6 for being overweight in adulthood compared with average-weight children; 1 study reported an OR of 7.0. One study showed older overweight children to be at greater risk than younger children for overweight in adulthood: children who were overweight at 2 years of age had an RR of 2.7, whereas children who were overweight at 11 years had an RR of 3.6. Obese children had similar results. A study of 4 age cohorts showed that children who were obese at 1 or 2 years of age had an OR of 1.3 for obesity in adulthood compared with average-weight peers. Obese children in the 3- to 5-year-old cohort had an OR of 4.7; obese children in the 6- to 9-year-old cohort had an OR of 8.8; and obese 10- to 14-year-olds had an OR of 22.3. As with children, overweight adolescents had a higher risk of being overweight in adulthood. And the association between older age and higher ORs persisted into adolescence. One study found an OR of 17.5 for adult overweight among youngsters who were overweight at 10 to 14 years of age and an OR of 22.3 for adolescents who were overweight at 15 to 17 years. The systematic review also revealed sex differences. Two studies showed that overweight or obese boys were not only more likely to be overweight in adulthood than their average-weight peers (OR=15.0 in 1 study; RR=9.8 in the other), but also more likely to be overweight later in life than overweight or obese girls. The girls had an OR of 12.0 for adult overweight in 1 study and an RR of 6.8 in the other.</longtext>

		<question>What is the best treatment for nocturnal enuresis in children?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>For children with primary nocturnal enuresis, treatment with enuresis alarms reduced the number of wet nights by almost 4 per week, with almost half of patients remaining dry for 3 months after treatment.</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">based on a systematic review of homogeneous randomized control trials [RCTs]</sor>
				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>The Cochrane Incontinence Group Trials demonstrated that enuresis alarms led to nearly 4 fewer wet nights per week compared with no treatment or placebo (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-3.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.52 to -2.78). The relative risk of failure was 0.36 compared with placebo (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.40). The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights is 2. About half the children relapse after stopping treatment, compared with nearly all children after control interventions (55% vs 99%). Evidence is insufficient to say whether the addition of dry bed training (scheduled awakenings, cleanliness training, social reinforcement, positive practice) improves the outcomes. Alarms that wake the child immediately (vs a time delay) and alarms that wake the child (instead of the parents) were slightly more effective.</longtext>

				<long id="4_1">
					<longtext>A prospective, nonequivalence, before-after study compared efficacy of, and complications from, laparoscopic surgery for symptomatic GERD between younger and older (≥65 years) patients. The investigators examined postoperative morbidity and mortality for 359 patients referred for laparoscopic surgery, either a partial or Nissen (full) fundoplication. They excluded those requiring more extensive surgery or repair of paraesophageal hernia. The 42 elderly patients had a higher mean American Society of Anesthesiologists score compared with the younger patients, reflecting higher preoperative comorbidity, but were similar with regard to weight and gender. Before surgery, investigators performed 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring. Preoperative exposure times to a pH below 4 (TpH &lt;4) were similar for the younger and older patients (median 14.2% and 13.9%, respectively). Postoperative complication rates were similar for both groups. No deaths occurred. Minor postoperative complications involved 7% of the elderly patients and 6% of the younger group. The 24-hour pH monitoring scores showed improvement at 6 weeks after surgery for both groups, with the median TpH &lt;4 at 1.1% (95% CL, 0.5) in the elderly vs a median of 1.8% (95% CL, 1.9) in the younger patients. At 1 year postoperatively, the values were also similar between the two groups; the median TpH &lt;4 (95% CL) were 1.4% (1.5) in the elderly group and 1.2% (0.6) in the younger patient group. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution, however.

The fungicidal allylamines (naftifine and terbinafine) and butenafine (allylamine derivative) are a more costly group of topical tinea treatments, yet they are more convenient as they allow for a shorter duration of treatment compared with fungistatic azoles (clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, miconazole, and sulconazole).</sniptext>

				<sniptext>Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are as effective as acetaminophen and nonselective NSAIDs in treating of osteoarthritis, and are equally effective in reducing pain and inflammation and improving of joint function for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, when compared with nonselective NSAIDs.

				<sniptext>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is diagnosed for women of childbearing age presenting with 2 of the following: 1) oligo- or anovulatory menstrual irregularities, 2) evidence of hyperandrogenism in the absence of secondary cause; 3) enlarged ovaries with multiple small follicular cysts on transvaginal ultrasound.</sniptext>

Clinical features include menstrual irregularities or infertility, hirsutism, male-pattern balding, acne, ovarian enlargement, and signs of insulin resistance (eg, central obesity, acanthosis nigricans). A 2003 international consensus panel concluded that the presence of 2 of 3 criteria (oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries), in the absence of other secondary causes, is sufficient to make the diagnosis. A high luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) ratio supports the diagnosis. However, because this measure varies considerably in relation to ovulation, body-mass index (BMI), and the particular measurement assay used, the consensus panel recommended against its use as a diagnostic criterion.</longtext>

		<question>What is the best treatment for hypertension in African Americans?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>In African Americans with hypertension, therapy is best initiated with the low-sodium Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and a thiazide-type diuretic.</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">based on randomized controlled trials</sor>
				<long id="1_3">
					<longtext>An RCT studied the effect of different levels of dietary sodium in conjunction with the DASH diet. A total of 412 participants were randomly assigned to eat either a control diet or the DASH diet. Within the assigned diet, participants ate foods with high (150 mmol/d), intermediate (100 mmol/d), and low (50 mmol/d) levels of sodium in random order. In this study, low-sodium DASH diet was associated with additional lowering of blood pressure, an effect that was also found to be stronger for African Americans patients than others. When compared with the combination of the control diet and a high level of sodium, the DASH diet and a low level of sodium lowered systolic blood pressure by 11.5 mm Hg for participants with hypertension (12.6 mm Hg for blacks; 9.5 mm Hg for others), and by 7.1 mm Hg for participants without hypertension (7.2 mm Hg for blacks; 6.9 mm Hg for others).</longtext>

			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Metered-dose inhalers with a spacer (MDI/S) are as good as, or better than, nebulizers for children with asthma.

					<longtext>Asthma is characterized by inflammation of the bronchial airways. Leukotrienes are potent mediators of inflammation and are believed to contribute significantly to the inflammatory pathophysiology of asthma.

In both studies, there was no statistical difference in lung cancer mortality between the 2 groups.</longtext>

				<long id="2_1">
					<longtext>In contrast to the pretreatment times for all other malarial prophylaxes, the generally accepted pretreatment time for mefloquine is 1 to 2 weeks before entering a risk area. However, this may still be inadequate due to the drug&apos;s long half-life, which results in a long delay in reaching therapeutic blood levels. The evidence indicates that mefloquine should be started at least 2, and as many as 7, weeks before travel.</longtext>

		<question>Do COX-2 inhibitors worsen renal function?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>No, COX-2 inhibitors, as a class, do not worsen renal function for those without renal disease. Celecoxib is the only COX-2 inhibitor available, and it is associated with a lower risk of renal dysfunction and hypertension when compared with controls. Available data do not allow for adjusted risk assessment for patients with preexisting renal disease on COX-2 inhibitors.</sniptext>

					<longtext>A randomized controlled trial compared standard dosing of diclofenac (75 mg twice daily) and ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times daily) with high-dose celecoxib (400 mg twice daily) for patients with normal kidney function being treated for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The mean increase in serum creatinine in the celecoxib arm was less than that noted in the diclofenac controls (0.009 mg/dL vs 0.027 mg/dL; P&lt;.05; number needed to harm [NNH]=56).

					<longtext>A 2006 meta-analysis, including 114 trials and 116,094 patients randomized to either cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor or control (placebo, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID], or mixed), indicated that the COX-2 inhibitors, as a class, had no effect on renal endpoints. Trials were reviewed for data on renal endpoints, including peripheral edema, hypertension, and renal dysfunction (defined as significant worsening of serum urea or creatinine, or clinical evidence of kidney disease and renal failure). When viewed separately, rofecoxib (Vioxx) was associated with a composite relative risk (RR) of 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.76) for all renal endpoints compared with controls. In contrast, the composite RR for the same endpoints among patients taking celecoxib (Celebrex) was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-1.12), indicating no effect on renal function. In fact, for the specific outcomes of hypertension and renal dysfunction, celecoxib was associated with a decreased risk compared with controls. Stratified analysis by type of control (placebo, alternate NSAID, or mixed) yielded consistent results; rofecoxib was uniquely associated with adverse renal outcomes. No effect on renal function was noted for celecoxib compared with the same controls: the RR for adverse renal effects was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.55-1.38), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.70-1.23), and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.94-1.69) for celecoxib vs placebo, NSAID, and mixed controls, respectively. Statistical analysis for heterogeneity showed that the variation in effects on renal function among the COX-2 inhibitors was more likely due to actual differences than due to chance (heterogeneity [I2]=57%; P&lt;.001).</longtext>

				<sniptext>There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening mammography beyond the age of 69 years.

				<sniptext>Recent studies have demonstrated a small but significant risk of adverse effects from combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT), including cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disease, and breast cancer. Time-limited HRT will control intolerable menopausal symptoms and prevent risk of fractures in newly menopausal women. However, HRT achieves its maximum efficacy in 35 years, and the risk of adverse outcomes increases as time progresses. Women considering HRT, particularly those at higher risk for vascular disease and breast cancer, should be informed of the potential risks.</sniptext>

		<question>Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>The jury is out as to whether you should treat asymptomatic carriers of group A streptococci (GAS), because no studies specifically address the issue. In addition, many patients are unlikely to care about their carrier status, although they probably care about symptoms and treatment side effects. Nonetheless, you may want to consider treating GAS carriers under the following circumstances: 1) Recurrent pharyngitis without cough or congestion. 2) Acute rheumatic fever or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis outbreaks. 3) GAS pharyngitis outbreaks in a closed community. 4) Family history of acute rheumatic fever. 5) Multiple documented GAS pharyngitis episodes within a family over several weeks despite therapy. 6) Excessive patient/family anxiety about GAS. 7) All treatment options, except tonsillectomy, have been exhausted.</sniptext>

			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Yes-acetaminophen is a safe and effective analgesic that can be appropriately used for adult patients with stable chronic alcoholic liver disease for at least a short period of time (studies have been limited to a maximum of 48-72 hours), up to the maximum recommended dosage of 4 g daily.</sniptext>

					<longtext>A systematic review (published in 2000) identified reports of acetaminophen toxicity, poisoning, or adverse events for alcohol patients. Researchers found 7 articles classified as Class I (studies utilizing randomized controlled trials) or Class 2 data (studies utilizing prospective, nonrandomized trials), and 20 articles that provided Class 3 data (retrospective case reviews and case reports). The studies of Class I and 2 data indicated therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen is safe for patients with liver disease, whereas the Class 3 (lower-quality) data suggest acetaminophen is toxic for patients with liver disease. This review concluded that, based on all the methodologically sound studies available (specifically those using the stronger evidence), therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen for the alcoholic patient is not associated with hepatic injury.</longtext>

				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>In a split-sample (derivation and validation) analysis of 3 prospective studies involving 1068 patients presenting to the hospital with the diagnosis of pneumonia, various clinical features were analyzed for their association with 30-day mortality. The 5 parameters that were most strongly associated with mortality were: acute confusion (odds ratio [OR]=8.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-13.7), BUN &gt;19.6 mg/dL (OR= 5.6; 95% CI, 3.1-10), respiratory rate ≥30 (OR=1.7; 95% CI, 1.07-2.8), low blood pressure (SBP &lt;90 or DBP ≤60) (OR=2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8) and age ≥65 years (OR=5.5; 95% CI, 2.8-10.9). The 30-day mortality estimation using these 5 criteria is called CURB-65 (Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, low Blood pressure, and age ≥65). In patients with 2 or more of these factors, the associated rate of mortality increased significantly compared with patients who had none or only 1 of the factors. Although albumin &lt;3.0 g/dL was also significantly associated with an increased mortality rate (OR=4.7; 95% CI, 2.5-8.7), it was not included in CURB-65 because it is not a routine lab ordered for patients with pneumonia. A variation of the CURB-65 score, CRB-65, uses only the clinical parameters without laboratory data (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age). Patients with a score of 0 had a 0.9% 30-day mortality rate. However, the rate increased to 8.15% when patients had 1 or 2 of the 4 clinical criteria..</longtext>

		<question>What is the differential diagnosis of chronic leg edema in primary care?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>The differential diagnosis, in descending order, includes: elevated pulmonary artery pressure (often due to obstructive sleep apnea), congestive heart failure, idiopathic causes, venous insufficiency, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and proteinuria (&gt;1 g daily).</sniptext>
				<sor type="B">based on a nonconsecutive diagnostic cohort study with good reference standards</sor>
				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>A nonconsecutive cohort study evaluated the causes of bilateral leg edema among 58 ambulatory adults (between 29 and 83 years of age) enrolled from an inner-city family medicine clinic in Cleveland. Edema was present for &gt;3 months in 78% of patients, and 84% were obese. Patients were excluded if the edema was known to be due to nifedipine, intra-abdominal malignancy, hypothyroidism, or idiopathic cyclic edema. Family physicians obtained a history and performed a physical exam on all patients and recorded a clinical diagnosis for the edema. Initial clinical impressions included: venous insufficiency (71%), congestive heart failure (18%), nephrotic syndrome (13%), uncertain (7%), and other causes (2% each). Other causes included lymphedema, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, hypoalbuminemia, NSAID or corticosteroid use, sleep apnea, and obesity. (Total percentages exceed 100% because some patients had multiple conditions.) All patients were then evaluated with a serum albumin, a 24-hour urine protein collection, echocardiogram, and lower extremity duplex venous ultrasound (13 of 58 patients did not complete the echocardiogram and venous duplex ultrasound). Investigators developed a final diagnosis using the results of this evaluation in conjunction with the clinical information obtained by the physician. Final diagnoses included pulmonary hypertension/borderline pulmonary hyper-tension (&gt;30 mm Hg) (42%), congestive heart failure (29%), idiopathic edema (27%), venous insufficiency (22%), medication use (15%, primarily corticosteroids and NSAIDs), proteinuria &gt;1 g/day (15%), and other causes (2% each). These other causes included transient renal disease, hypoalbuminemia, lymphedema, and stenosis of the inferior vena cava. (Total percentages again exceed 100% because some patients had multiple diagnoses.) All 15 patients with cardiac conditions and 17 of 19 patients with pulmonary hypertension were over 45 years of age. Of the 19 patients with pulmonary hypertension, 6 had CHF, 4 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 4 had sleep apnea diagnosed in subsequent testing, 1 had an atrial septal defect, and 4 appeared to have primary pulmonary hypertension. The investigators recommended 3 steps to evaluate chronic leg edema. 1) Stop any potentially causative medicines, such as NSAIDs or calcium-channel blockers. 2) Obtain an echocardiogram if the patient is 45 years of age or older. 3) Obtain a sleep study if the echo-cardiogram reveals pulmonary hypertension without an apparent cause.</longtext>

					<longtext>In term, healthy newborns, TSH levels normally increase to levels of 60 mU/L within 30 minutes of delivery. This is followed by a rapid decline in TSH levels over the first 5 days of life to &lt;10 mU/L. An Australian study found more elevated TSH levels for samples drawn on day 2 of life compared with day 3 of life, likely reflecting normal postnatal physiology. Age-specific reference ranges are necessary for interpretation of TSH levels during the first 5 days of life.

A total of 4762 citations were evaluated; only 19 met their criteria for full consideration. The interventions studied included combinations of patient and family counseling (verbal, written, telephone, and automated); patient involvement in self-monitoring of outcomes (eg, blood pressure); simplified medication regimens; reminders of appointments, refills, and pill schedules; and care provided at the workplace. All interventions were for single clinical conditions including hypertension (7 studies), schizophrenia and psychosis (6), asthma (2), acute infection (2), hyperlipidemia (1), and epilepsy (1). Both of the studies concerning simplifying medication regimens showed a positive effect on medication adherence.

				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>A Cochrane review of 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs)-6 double-blinded, 2287 children total-compared antibiotics with placebo for uncomplicated AOM in otherwise healthy children. The review showed that children treated with antibiotics were no less likely to have pain at 24 hours after starting therapy than untreated children. However, 7% fewer children who received antibiotics had pain at 2 to 7 days than unmedicated children (number needed to treat [NNT]=15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11-24). Children treated with antibiotics had no significant decrease in recurrence of AOM (mean 0.70 vs 0.63; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.34; odds ratio [OR]=0.99) or hearing loss (reported by a combination of tympanometry and audiometry). They did have an increase in nausea, diarrhea, and rash, however. Only 1 case of mastoiditis was reported in the included studies. Of note, 2 of the studies showed a modest increase in failure rates of placebo treatment for children younger than 2 years and children with bilateral disease. Antibiotics may benefit these groups. Overall, both the potential benefits and harms of antibiotics for AOM are small.</longtext>

					<longtext>A meta-analysis of eight RCTs addressing the use of metformin or clomiphene for treatment of PCOS were reviewed for ovulation and pregnancy rates. Metformin is 50% better than placebo for ovulation induction among infertile PCOS patients (relative risk [RR]=1.50; 95% CI, 1.31-1.99), but this benefit is not necessarily improved with longer duration (&gt;3 months) of therapy (RR=1.37; 95% CI, 1.05-1.79).

					<longtext>A review of 7 RCTs describes the evidence accumulated by well-designed trials and its clinical relevance. Metformin improves ovulation and menstrual cyclicity but these improvements were variable and modest. On average, 1 additional ovulation is attained in every 5-month interval with metformin treatment; specifically, the baseline of 1 ovulation per 5-month interval increased to 2 ovulations per 5-month interval. Spontaneous ovulation and normal menstruation are achieved rapidly (within 3 months of the start of therapy). These data corroborate the benefits of metformin but place its clinical significance in perspective. For PCOS patients seeking cycle regulation but not pregnancy, oral contraceptives may remain better therapy because metformin does not normalize menses.</longtext>

					<longtext>A large randomized trial of 579 children with ADHD (20% girls) aged 7 to 9.9 years compared outcomes of 4 treatment strategies: stimulant medication, intensive behavioral treatment, combined stimulant medication and behavioral interventions, and standard community care. All children met the DSM-IV. criteria for ADHD Combined Type (the most common type of ADHD in this age group). The stimulant medication strategy included an initial dose titration period followed by monthly 30-minute visits. Intensive behavioral treatment involved child, parent, and school personnel components of therapy. Combination therapy added the regimens for medication and behavioral treatment together. Standard community care consisted of usual (nonsystematic) care, evaluated at 6 different sites. After 14 months of treatment, children in the medication group and the combined treatment groups showed more improvement in ADHD symptoms than children given intensive behavioral treatment or those who received standard community care. When combined with medication, those treated with behavioral therapy showed slight improvement in social skills, anxiety, aggression, oppositional behavior, and academic achievement over medication alone. At the conclusion of the study, 74% of the 212 children on medication were successfully maintained on methylphenidate alone, 10% required dextroamphetamine, and no children required more than one medication. This study found that higher doses of medication with more frequent office follow-up and regular school contact were important features of successful treatment. Only 40% of families were able to complete the intensive behavioral therapy.</longtext>

All studies included in the review compared a group-based parent training program with a no-treatment wait-list control group and assessed outcomes using a standardized measure of behavior. In studies where sufficient data were provided, effect sizes ranged from 0.6 to 2.9. This indicates that, on a standardized child behavioral measure, parental report of children&apos;s externalizing problems decreased by 0.6 to 2.9 standard deviations from pre- to posttreatment (an effect size of &gt;0.8 is considered large).

				<sniptext>It&apos;s difficult to say which treatment is best, since most studies don&apos;t compare treatments directly. Pros and cons vary. Simple surgical excision is associated with a low risk of recurrence, but often leaves a visible scar.

					<longtext>If current therapies for localized therapy do not decrease morbidity or mortality, screening higher-risk groups merely puts them at increased risk for potentially harmful interventions. Biopsies cannot reliably predict which cancers will progress and which will lie indolent. The 30% incidence of CaP on autopsy means that more people die with CaP than from it. Using estimates of the prevalence and natural history of the disease, decision analyses report varying years saved by screening compared with watchful waiting (ranging from a gain of 2.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to an actual decrease in QALYs, depending primarily on the rate of progression to metastatic disease and efficacy of treatment.</longtext>

		<question>Does increasing methylphenidate dose aid symptom control in ADHD?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1" comment="No sor, no long.">
				<sniptext>Most children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who are started on methylphenidate will respond favorably to a dose increase if the initial dose does not sufficiently reduce symptoms. Once titrated to an effective maintenance dose, frequent follow-up is necessary to monitor for side effects and recurring symptoms. The dose of methylphenidate can then be increased further for better symptom control, which may be warranted in most cases.</sniptext>
				<sor type="">None</sor>
			</snip>
			<snip id="2">
				<sniptext>In some children, methylphenidate may not achieve response even at high doses or may cause intolerable side effects. For these children, start a different stimulant medication.</sniptext>
				<sor type="B">based on extrapolation of 1 randomized controlled trial</sor>
				<long id="2_1">
					<longtext>The National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (known as the MTA study) is the longest treatment study of children to date. This study-a 28-day, double-blind placebo-controlled trial-enrolled children aged 7 to 9 years with ADHD and compared 4 treatment strategies (including medication and behavioral interventions) over 14 months. Of particular interest was the dose-titration evaluation at the beginning of the study. Daily dose-switching titration of methylphenidate was used to identify the optimal starting dose for each child assigned to receive medication. In all, 289 children were randomized to receive methylphenidate, and 256 completed the titration (17 children refused to take medication, 1 moved, 4 had side effects, 4 had missing data, and 7 stopped mid-titration because of inability to follow the titration protocol). Of the 256 children who completed titration, 198 (77%) responded favorably to 1 of the following doses: low (15 mg/day), intermediate (25 mg/day), or high (35 mg/day for children weighing less than 25 kg; or 50 mg/day for children weighing 25 kg or more). Of the remaining 23%, 32 children responded best to placebo and 26 were methylphenidate nonresponders and were subsequently placed on dextroamphetamine. Children who responded to methylphenidate entered the 13-month maintenance phase on the optimal dose identified in the titration trial. They were monitored by monthly re-examination and review of information from parents and teachers regarding ADHD symptoms and potential drug side effects. The dose was changed if symptoms were not well controlled or if side effects were present. Subsequently, if no effective and well-tolerated dose of methylphenidate could be identified, the drug was deemed ineffective for that child and was replaced by another medication.</longtext>

		<question>Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>For children with recurrent acute otitis media (here defined as 3 or more episodes in 6 months, or 4 or more in a year), tympanostomy tubes are indicated if middle-ear effusion is present. Tubes reduce the frequency of recurrent acute otitis media by 2 to 3 episodes per year in these patients.</sniptext>

					<longtext>The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement 2001 guidelines for recurrent acute otitis media treatment in children recommends initial antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin 20 mg/kg/day for 2 to 6 months based on randomized controlled trial data.

			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>In the initial management of dyspepsia for patients without &quot;alarm&quot; symptoms (weight loss, recurrent vomiting, dysphagia, anemia, evidence of bleeding, onset of dyspepsia after age 45 years), therapy based on the results of early endoscopy was not better than empiric acid suppression (antisecretory therapy) or a Helicobacter pylori &quot;test and treat&quot; strategy in reducing symptoms or improving quality of life.</sniptext>

					<longtext>Though individual studies have suggested that therapy based on endoscopy performed before any other study (early endoscopy) may be superior to empiric antisecretory therapy and as efficacious as a &quot;test and treat&quot; strategy in symptom relief, a Cochrane systematic review of 20 RCTs (11 in primary care settings) provides the best evidence on the role of early endoscopy. A subgroup analysis of 5 RCTs, which compared early endoscopy with empiric antisecretory therapy (typically for 4 weeks), revealed that early endoscopy demonstrated a trend towards improvement in self-reported symptoms and in dyspepsia symptom relief scores, but the difference was not statistically significant (relative risk [RR]=0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.1). Because each study used different symptom scores, the relative risk as calculated may under-represent the true benefit of early endoscopy when compared with empiric antisecretory therapy.</longtext>

					<longtext>The 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) defines malingering as &quot;the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms motivated by external incentives such as avoiding military duty, avoiding work, obtaining financial compensation, evading criminal prosecution, or obtaining drugs.&quot; Malingering is not considered a mental disorder because symptoms are intentionally produced for external incentives. No physical exam maneuver can determine a patien&apos; external incentives. Traditionally, a physician uses certain exam techniques to determine if symptoms are of functional, or nonorganic, origin. Both terms denote the absence of a structural or physiological source for the phenomena, and include malingering and mental disorders such as factitious disorder, conversion disorder, and somatoform disorders.

				<sor type="A">based on a systematic review</sor>
				<long id="1_3">
					<longtext>Individually, OAE and ABR accurately diagnose neonatal hearing loss. One multicenter cohort of 2995 infants measured test performance of OAE and ABR against the gold standard (visual reinforcement audiometry performed at 8-12 months). The authors used a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve to plot speech awareness thresholds for both tests. When middle-ear pathology and progressive hearing loss were excluded, the area under the ROC curves for ABR and OAE were 0.91 and 0.94, respectively, indication that both tests had excellent test accuracy (a perfect test would have an area under the curve of 1.0).</longtext>

					<longtext>A systematic review gathered studies comparing universal hearing screening with selective screening. Most included studies used a 2-stage universal screening protocol. Infants who failed initial testing were retested within 12 weeks. Testing methods included otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR). Infants who failed the second test were referred for audiological evaluation. Using these data, a hypothetical model was created, which found that 1441 newborns would need to be screened to diagnose 1 additional case of moderate-to-profound permanent hearing loss before 10 months of age (at cost of 200 extra referrals for false-positives). Sensitivity and specificity of the hypothetical model&apos;s 2-stage screening was 85% and 97%, respectively. The estimated positive predictive value was 6.7%.</longtext>

			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>They&apos;re useful in diagnosing Graves&apos; disease and, to a lesser extent, autoimmune thyroid disease; they can also help predict hypothyroidism. thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) may be mildly elevated in a variety of thyroid disorders, but a TRAb level &gt;10 U/L increases the probability of Graves&apos; disease by a moderate to large degree.</sniptext>

					<longtext>The Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP-R) is a 24-item, self-administered questionnaire that stratifies patients being considered for opioid therapy into lower or higher risk for future opioid-related aberrant behaviors. Each item queries frequency of behaviors and emotions consistent with opioid misuse and can be scored as 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The items on the SOAPP-R were developed by a consensus panel of pain and addiction experts. In a multidisciplinary pain center study, the SOAPP-R was administered to 283 chronic pain patients who were followed for 5 months. At a cutoff score of ≥18, the test had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 3.80 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.29 for detecting opioid misuse. At this cutoff, the SOAPP-R was 81% sensitive and 68% specific for predicting patients at high risk for aberrant behavior.</longtext>

The odds ratio for OME persisting after short-term follow-up was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.20-3.19); after intermediate follow-up the odds ratio was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.21-2.44). This study, which included a symptom score after 3 months, favored treatment, with a weighted mean difference of -4.5, but with wide 95% CI of -10.28 to 1.28. An effect was demonstrated on clearing effusions in the short term, but the advantage appeared to vanish for the most part by 3 months. The study did not evaluate improvements in hearing.</longtext>

They derived a clinical decision rule designed to balance false positives and false negatives. It recommends immediate antibiotic treatment if women have ≥2 of 4 signs or symptoms: dysuria, leukocyte esterase (greater than trace), positive nitrites, or blood (greater than trace) on dipstick (LR+=2.29).

		<question>Does ambulatory blood pressure monitoring aid in the management of patients with hypertension?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has a higher correlation with target end-organ damage than standard office measurements and is superior for risk stratification. Because it is more complicated to implement than office-based measurements, it should be reserved for: establishing the diagnosis of white-coat hypertension or borderline hypertension in previously untreated patients; evaluating previously treated patients with resistant hypertension; diagnosing and treating hypertension disorders of pregnancy; and identifying nocturnal hypertension.</sniptext>

		<question>What is the target for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with heart disease?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Large published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that pravastatin and simvastatin are well-tolerated and reduce major coronary events such as death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization by about 25%. The Heart Protection Study suggested this benefit is noted even among individuals with pretreatment low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of less than 100 mg/dL. Fluvastatin reduces major coronary events, but current studies are too small to prove reduced overall mortality. The best evidence to date suggests that most patients at significant risk for major coronary events should be given pravastatin or simvastatin 40 mg daily, without concern for the initial or follow-up LDL levels.</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">based on large randomized trials</sor>
				<long id="1_6">
					<longtext>The National Cholesterol Education Project NCEP recommends that patients with CAD and an LDL of more than 130 mg/dL adopt therapeutic lifestyle changes and start LDL-lowering medication, usually a statin. For patients with LDL between 100 and 130 mg/dL, the NCEP recommends therapeutic lifestyle changes, with the option of adding a statin. For patients with LDL less than 100 mg/dL, maintenance of LDL control is recommended with therapeutic lifestyle changes. For patients with high initial LDL levels that stay above 100 mg/dL on statin therapy, the NCEP recommends that additional medications, such as nicotinic acid or fibrates, as well as intensive therapeutic lifestyle changes, be considered.</longtext>

The benefit of simvastatin was noted in virtually every predefined subgroup, including individuals older than 70 years, women, and patients without known CAD (but with CAD equivalents). Notably, no difference in benefit was found between patients with different pretreatment LDL levels. A significant reduction in major vascular events was noted even for the 3400 subjects with pretreatment LDL levels of less than 100 mg/dL (NNT = 22, P =.0006).

		<question>Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Conclusions regarding the ThinPrep are difficult to make due to the complexity of cervical cancer screening and the lack of adequate outcome-based data. However, current evidence supports the following: the ThinPrep is more sensitive than the conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smear at detecting cervical cancer.</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">based on 1 large validating cohort study with a good reference standard and 1 systematic review</sor>
				<long id="1_3">
					<longtext>A recent quantitative review implies that the ThinPrep increases cytologic diagnoses of cervical cancer and its precursors. A strength of this review is the inclusion of 10 articles with histology as the reference standard. The data from 21,752 patients compared the sensitivity and specificity rates of Thin Prep with conventional Pap for detecting abnormal histology. Sensitivity rates were reported as 76% (ThinPrep) and 68% (conventional), but the differences met statistical significance in only 2 of the included studies. Similarly, the overall specificity rates of the ThinPrep vs conventional Pap was 86% vs 79%, and again the differences did not usually reach statistical significance. The authors hypothesize that widespread use of ThinPrep could potentially detect an additional 162,000 patients with HSIL and 3000 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma.</longtext>

				<long id="1_2">
					<longtext>This prospective, population-based study of 8636 women reported that the ThinPrep was significantly more sensitive than the conventional smears at detecting high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and cancer, with sensitivity rates of 92.9% and 100% vs 77.8% and 90.9%, respectively (P&lt;.001).

					<longtext>The conventional Pap smear is the standard screening test for cervical neoplasia. Despite success, the Pap smear has high false-negative rates due to poor sensitivity (51%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 37%-66%). The ThinPrep was developed to improve sensitivity by providing a monolayer of cells to the cytologist for review. A population-based comparative analysis of good quality shows that the new technology is better at detecting cancer precursors, but other systematic reviews that include less rigorous studies can only suggest it.</longtext>

Ten trials included statins. Of the 5 studies that reported age, the average was 61 years. For women without CVD, lipid-lowering treatment was not shown to affect total or CHD mortality. For women with known CVD, hyperlipidemia treatment did not affect total mortality, but was shown effective in reducing CHD events, CHD mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization; the relative risk of CHD events for statin users was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.91).

					<longtext>One systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis investigated the appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of screening methods for familial hypercholesterolemia beginning at the age of 16 years. The authors identified potential screening strategies from 6 cross-sectional studies and applied these to a decision analysis. Screening of first-degree relatives of those with familial hypercholesterolemia was most effective in detecting cases of familial hypercholesterolemia (number needed to screen [NNS]=3; cost per case detected=$232; cost per life-year gained=$5397). Universal screening of all 16-year-olds was also cost-effective (cost per life-year gained=$4839), but resulted in a much larger NNS and cost of detection (NNS=1365, cost per case detected=$16,999). The authors concluded that case finding through screening of first-degree relatives was the most cost-effective strategy overall.</longtext>

Many subjects also used vitamin D and calcium, but effective doses of both agents are still in question. Combined calcium and vitamin D supplements have decreased fracture risk using 700 to 800 IU of vitamin D and 500 to 1200 mg of calcium daily,9 but a systematic review of vitamin D without calcium found no clear benefit.10 A meta-analysis showed that exercise training programs may play a preventive role, potentially preventing or reversing 1% of bone loss annually among women.</longtext>

				<long id="2_1">
					<longtext>While cough longer than 2 weeks, inspiratory whoop, posttussive vomiting, coughing paroxysms, and absence of fever are commonly associated with pertussis, relatively few studies have assessed the sensitivities and specificities of these symptoms. Comparison groups were variously defined by negative pertussis cultures, negative pertussis serology, or serologic confirmation of other respiratory infections. Likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated from the data presented in each paper. The magnitude and variability of these likelihood ratios suggest that individual symptoms may be of limited help in distinguishing pertussis from other causes of prolonged cough. Combinations of symptoms may be slightly more helpful. In a study comparing 10 patients with culture-confirmed pertussis with 10 patients with serologically confirmed mycoplasma pneumonia, the combination of cough &gt;14 days and whoop had a sensitivity of 80%, a positive LR (LR+) of 8 and a negative LR (LR-) of 0.22.</longtext>

Patients were offered an individualized exercise plan with supervised aerobic exercise plus circuit-type resistance sessions 3 times a week. Nutritionists met with patients 7 times in the first year and every 3 months after that. Patients were counseled to increase fiber intake, reduce total fat below 30% of total calories, and reduce saturated fat below 10%. The control group was given general information on diet and exercise without individualized programs. Most patients (86%) in the intervention group met their exercise goal, and 25% met the fiber requirement.

Patients were men and women from primary care populations and represented diverse ethnic backgrounds. Investigators defined IGT as plasma glucose of 140 to 200 mg/dL 2 hours after a 75-g glucose bolus when the fasting glucose was &lt;140 mg/dL. Intensive lifestyle intervention comprised individual training sessions on a low-calorie, low-fat diet, aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking), and behavior modification. Case managers met with each participant for at least 16 sessions during the first 24 weeks and at least monthly thereafter. The control group received lifestyle change recommendations without individualized attention. After 24 weeks, 50% of the lifestyle group met the 7% weight loss goal and 74% were exercising at least 150 minutes per week. At the final visit, 38% maintained their target weight and 58% met their exercise goal.

		<question>How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Case series show that hypokalemia following initiation of diuretic therapy occurs in most patients within 2 to 8 weeks. However, no studies are available that adequately predict the risk of this complex and multifactorial condition. Patients taking diuretics should have a potassium level checked in the first 2 to 8 weeks after initiating therapy. Mild hypokalemia (3.1 to 3.4 mmol/L) may be transient, so a repeat measurement may be considered before initiating potassium replacement. Dietary sodium restriction may also help to conserve potassium, because this will decrease urinary flow rate and potassium loss. The frequency with which to check potassium levels should be guided by the patients&apos; underlying clinical conditions and dietary potassium and sodium intake.</sniptext>

		<question>Do beta-blockers worsen respiratory status for patients with COPD?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who use cardioselective beta-blockers (beta1-blockers) do not experience a significant worsening of their short-term pulmonary status as measured by changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), or by changes in patients&apos; self-reported symptoms. If such harmful effects do exist, they are likely to be less clinically important than the substantial proven benefits of beta-blockade for patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease.</sniptext>
				<sor type="A">based on a high-quality meta-analysis of controlled trials</sor>
				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>A 2004 meta-analysis synthesized the data of 19 clinical controlled trials that compared active therapy with either placebo or prior-to-treatment controls, assessing differences in FEV1, response to a beta2-agonist, and patient-reported respiratory symptoms. Trials included in the meta-analysis used cardioselective beta-blockers and evaluated either single-dose treatments or therapy of longer duration (2 days to 3.3 months). The authors concluded that patients with COPD who received cardioselective beta-blockers (such as metoprolol, atenolol, or bisoprolol) did not experience a statistically significant short-term deterioration in FEV1, worsening of COPD symptoms, or decreased responsiveness to beta2-agonists. The authors reported similar results for an analysis restricted to only those patients with severe COPD. This meta-analysis was limited by the relatively small number of participants (N=141 in single-dose treatment studies; N=126 in studies of longer duration treatment) in the handful of eligible studies. Consequently, rare or minimally harmful effects could have gone undetected.</longtext>

		<question>What is angular cheilitis and how is it treated?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Cheilitis is a broad term that describes inflammation of the lip surface characterized by dry scaling and fissuring. Specific types are atopic, angular, granulomatous, and actinic. Angular cheilitis is commonly seen in primary care settings, and it specifically refers to cheilitis that radiates from the commissures or corners of the mouth. Other terms synonymous with angular cheilitis are perlèche, commissural cheilitis, and angular stomatitis.

Patients were randomly given a 1-month supply of nystatin, amphotericin B, or placebo and instructed to dissolve 4 lozenges a day in their mouth. The study did not describe any blinding procedure. Both nystatin and amphotericin B had statistically significant cures rates at 1 month compared with placebo (P=.05 and P=0.01, respectively). The NNT was 2.7 for the nystatin group and 2.0 for the amphotericin B group at 1 month. A comparison of the 2 anti-fungals found no difference in cure rate.

				<long id="2_1">
					<longtext>A randomized controlled, double-blind study, performed in 21 English nursing facilities, enrolled 164 patients aged 60 years and older with some natural teeth and evaluated the effects of medicated chewing gum on oral health. At the end of 1 year, the 111 patients (67%) completed the study. Fifty-seven percent of the participants wore dentures. Several aspects were measured including the presence of angular cheilitis. There were 3 arms: no gum, xylitol gum, and chlorhexidine acetate/xylitol gum. The gums were used after breakfast and the evening meal and consisted of 2 pellets to be chewed for 15 minutes. Adherence was described as chewing gum at least 12 times per week for 12 months. A blinded investigator examined patients at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The results demonstrated a decrease in angular cheilitis in both the xylitol and chlorhexidine acetate/xylitol group at 12 months when compared to the no gum group (P&lt;.01). Cheilitis was found in 14% of the xylitol group (compared with 27% at baseline), 7% of the chlorhexidine acetate/xylitol group (a reduction from 28%), and 32% of the no gum group (no change). The NNT was 7.7 for the xylitol group and 4.8 for the chlorhexidine acetate/xylitol group.

		<question>What&apos;s the most practical way to rule out adrenal insufficiency?</question>

			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>A morning serum cortisol level &gt;13 mcg/dL reliably rules out adrenal insufficiency, and the test is easy and safe to perform. Because of low specificity, patients with a level of ≤13 mcg/dL need further evaluation with the cosyntropin stimulation test (CST).</sniptext>

				<long id="1_1">
					<longtext>A meta-analysis, based on a PubMed search of English-language studies from 1966 to 2006, compared the performance of morning serum cortisol, the 1 mcg CST, and the 250 mcg CST for diagnosing secondary adrenal insufficiency. This analysis used patient-level data obtained from the original investigators instead of reported study-level results. Data from patients described as normal, healthy control subjects were excluded. Studies included in the meta-analysis used an accepted gold-standard test, such as the insulin tolerance test or metyrapone test. Studies that were performed in a critical care setting or used older, less reliable cortisol assays were excluded, as were studies for which patient-level data couldn&apos;t be obtained. Three new studies were included, and 12 of the previously used studies were excluded. Instead of using the reported cortisol cutoff levels, the authors defined a negative test as the mean cortisol level (the &quot;rule-out threshold&quot;) above which the negative likelihood ratio of adrenal insufficiency is &lt;0.15. The rule-out thresholds for morning serum cortisol, 1 mcg CST, and 250 mcg CST were 13, 22, and 30 mcg/dL, respectively. The authors proposed an optimal testing strategy for secondary adrenal insufficiency (assuming a low or moderate pretest probability) that starts with a morning serum cortisol measurement: A serum cortisol level &gt;13 mcg/dL can effectively rule out adrenal insufficiency, if the morning serum cortisol is &lt;13 mcg/dL, a 1 mcg CST &gt;22 mcg/dL can rule out adrenal insufficiency, patients would need an insulin tolerance test or metyrapone test only if the low-dose CST is &lt;22 mcg/dL.</longtext>

					<longtext>A 2005 meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of HA injections for osteoarthritis of the knee compared with saline placebo. Researchers identified 22 studies of 8 HA products that used the common end point of pain with movement. A decrease in pain of 15% was deemed clinically meaningful. Compared with placebo, the mean difference in pain scores with HA products was -4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -9% to 1%) after 2 to 6 weeks; -4% (95% CI, -8% to -1%) after 10 to 14 weeks; and -7% (95% CI, -12% to -2%) after 22 to 30 weeks. The authors note that the small measured effect of HA was magnified by trials that didn&apos;t report intention-to-treat results. The effect of HA was also larger in studies that didn&apos;t conceal allocation. A weakness of the analysis was its inability to assess potential differences between HA products. In this 2005 meta-analysis, HA injection didn&apos;t improve knee function in any time interval.</longtext>

					<longtext>A retrospective cohort study of 32 patients in a sports medicine clinic demonstrated that early cryotherapy (within 36 hours of injury) for grades 3 and 4 ankle sprains, when compared with early heat therapy, resulted in earlier return to activity, as defined by ability to walk, climb stairs, run, and jump without pain. Grade 3 sprains treated with ice recovered in 11.0 days vs 14.8 days with heat. Grade 4 sprains treated with ice recovered in 13.2 days vs 30.4 days with heat.

		<question>Is guaifenesin safe during pregnancy?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>It&apos;s not clear; little evidence supports or refutes the safety of guaifenesin, a common expectorant, in pregnancy. A small number of observational and case-control studies suggest a weak association between guaifenesin use and inguinal hernias and neural tube defects in newborns. However, substantial methodological flaws, the absence of statistical significance, and low rates of prevalence cast a shadow of a doubt over the data.</sniptext>
				<sor type="B">based on observational and case-control studies</sor>
				<long id="1_4">
					<longtext>Because of the significant potential for recall bias, interpret the findings of these case-control studies with caution. The mother of a child with a birth defect may search her memory more aggressively for potential causes than a mother of a healthy infant, leading to different rates of recalled, rather than actual, exposures. In the absence of confirmatory prospective data, such as medication diaries or pharmacy databases, recall bias accounts for many spurious positive findings in case control studies.</longtext>

				<long id="1_3">
					<longtext>In a study evaluating 6509 women whose pregnancies resulted in live births, 241 women reported first-trimester exposure to guaifenesin. Five of the guaifenesin-exposed infants (2.1%) had 1 of the birth defects studied (types of disorders not reported). The calculated RR of birth defect after in utero guaifenesin exposure was 1.3 (no CIs or P values reported); the authors concluded that there was no strong association between guaifenesin and the malformations studied.</longtext>

				<long id="1_2">
					<longtext>Guaifenesin use in pregnancy may also be associated with neural tube defects. In a case-control study, researchers identified 538 fetuses and live-born infants with neural tube defects between 1989 and 1991. Twelve patients with neural tube defects were exposed to guaifenesin during gestation; 6 in the control group reported exposure. The authors reported a trend towards increased risk of neural tube defects in offspring of guaifenesin-exposed mothers (odds ratio=2.04; 95% CI, 0.79-5.28). However, since the results were not statistically significant, the authors concluded that guaifenesin had not contributed to the occurrence of neural tube defects.</longtext>

					<longtext>Guaifenesin use in pregnancy has been associated with inguinal hernias in newborns.

From this initial group, only 50,282 mother-child pairs were studied. Trained examiners interviewed the women at the child&apos;s 4, 8, 12, and 24-month visits, and then annually thereafter to 8 years of age. The examiners identified 7 children with inguinal hernias among 197 mothers who had used guaifenesin during their first trimester (standardized relative risk [RR] of 2.6; no CI or P value reported). Twenty children had inguinal hernias among the 1337 mothers who had used guaifenesin during any trimester of their pregnancy (RR=1.1; no confidence interval [CI] or P value reported). The authors acknowledged that reporting bias among the participating centers prevented them from drawing any conclusions from the data.</longtext>

		<question>Does lowering diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg decrease cardiovascular risk?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Although lowering diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with reduced cardiovascular events, systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a more robust predictor of cardiovascular risk than DBP and should now be used to diagnose, stage, and treat hypertension. Lowering diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to &lt;90 mm Hg in hypertensive individuals of all ages decreases the risk of cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, and sudden death. However, there is no consensus regarding how far to lower DBP. A &quot;J-shaped&quot; increase in cardiovascular risks with DBP &lt;85 mm Hg may apply under certain conditions.</sniptext>

				<sniptext>For proximal saphenous vein thrombosis, anticoagulation is more effective than venous ligation (with or without stripping) in preventing deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE).</sniptext>
				<sor type="C">qualitative systematic review of primarily case series</sor>

					<longtext>Since saphenous vein thrombosis above the knee is associated with DVT and PE, 1 systematic review looked at papers comparing anticoagulation (IV heparin followed by 6 weeks to 6 months of warfarin) with surgical ligation of the saphenous vein (either alone or combined with vein stripping or with vein stripping and perforator ligation). The review included primarily case series with widely varying protocols. According to the authors, the data &quot;suggests that medical management with anticoagulants is somewhat superior&quot; to surgery for preventing DVT and PE. However, the fewest extensions of SVTP occurred when vein ligation was combined with stripping of the thrombosed vein and interruption of perforators.</longtext>

		<question>What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Short-acting hypnotics such as zolpidem (Ambien) or zaleplon (Sonata) are the preferred hypnotics in the elderly because of an improved side-effect profile compared with traditional hypnotics such as benzodiazepines. Zolpidem and zaleplon have a quick onset and short duration of action, making them less likely to cause residual sedation, cognitive changes, and falls than benzodiazepines. More comparative clinical trials in the elderly are needed to determine if zolpidem and zaleplon are truly safer than benzodiazepines in this population. Hypnotics should be prescribed on a short-term, intermittent basis as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses any underlying causes of poor sleep.</sniptext>

				<sniptext>Obtain a repeat morning testosterone level, as well as levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin to help understand the cause of low testosterone when there is a lack of adequate empiric evidence to guide evaluation, advise the experts. When low or normal FSH and LH levels accompany low testosterone, evaluation of the pituitary gland is recommended. Chromosomal studies are indicated in prepubertal males with low testosterone and elevated FSH and LH levels to assess for Klinefelter syndrome. Perform a semen analysis if fertility is an issue.

In 2 trials, the 300 participants stimulated 1 breast for 1 hour a day for 3 days; in the other 4 trials, 419 women stimulated either breast alternately for 3 hours a day. Breast stimulation significantly reduced the number of women who hadn&apos;t gone into labor at 72 hours compared with nonintervention (62.7% vs 93.6%; relative risk [RR]=0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.74; number needed to treat [NNT]=3.2). This result remained significant when primiparous and multiparous women were analyzed separately, but not in the 1 trial (37 participants) that reported on women with an unfavorable cervix. Breast stimulation also reduced postpartum hemorrhage (0.7% vs 6%; RR=0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.87; NNT=18.8). None of the trials documented uterine hyperstimulation or meconium-stained fluid, and they didn&apos;t find significant differences in the rates of cesarean section (9% vs 10%; RR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.38-2.12).

		<question>When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics?</question>
		<answer>
			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>Children with suspected or culture-proven acute nonvenereal bacterial conjunctivitis should be treated with topical antibiotics, which hastens clinical and microbiological remission and may prevent potentially serious morbidity. In light of recent evidence regarding the self-limiting nature of conjunctivitis in adults and the development of antibiotic resistance, a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach with careful follow-up may be reasonable for adults, but this approach has not been evaluated.</sniptext>
				<sor type="C">based on extrapolation from systematic reviews of specialty clinic trials and cohort studies.</sor>
				<long id="1_7">
					<longtext>Overall, this evidence suggests that for adults, watchful waiting rather than initially treating with antibiotics is reasonable, given the self-limited nature and lack of serious outcomes in untreated patients as well as growing concern about antibiotic resistance. Note that this recommendation applies only to acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis. It is generally accepted that conjunctivitis caused by gonococcus or chlamydia should be suspected in all newborns and in severe cases in sexually active young adults. These cases warrant culturing and antibiotic treatment to prevent serious complications.</longtext>

Patients given the active substances were told it would reduce withdrawal symptoms; patients given placebo were not given this advice. All patients received education about the pathophysiology of rebound headaches, kept a headache diary, and were phoned weekly to ensure compliance. In addition, they all received capsules containing gradually increasing doses of atenolol, nortriptyline, and flunarazine (a calcium channel blocker not FDA-approved.) Indo-methacin and chlorpromazine were used as needed. Results from the first 6 days showed no difference in headaches between the 3 groups; however, significantly more patients used chlorpromazine in the &quot;no pharmacologic treatment&quot; group. By the end of 5 weeks, headache frequency was significantly reduced in all groups from baseline; however, there were no differences between groups in headache frequency or intensity in this small study. Of note, there were statistically fewer withdrawal symptoms and less use of rescue medications among patients who received the initial prophylactic treatments. The indomethacin rescue use was 24%, 18%, and 14% of patients for the no prophylactic treatment, prednisone, and naratriptan groups respectively, while chlorpromazine rescue use was 14%, 0%, and 0%, respectively.

					<longtext>One study prospectively followed patients ≥15 years old recruited from 16 hospitals in Sweden, who had their first or second episode of a VTE. Patients with malignancy or a known congenital deficiency of an inhibitor of coagulation were excluded. These patients were followed for 4 years. Each received at least 6 months of warfarin therapy (INR=2.0-2.85) after initial diagnosis of a VTE. After treatment, the 4-year recurrence rate for VTEs was 29% for patients with aPL (20/68) vs 14% for patients without (47/344) (relative risk [RR]=2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.3). The risk of death for those patients with aPL was 15% (10/68) vs 6% for those without (20/324) (RR=1.8; 95% CI, 0.9-3.6). In the same study, those with an aPL and a second clot were randomized to a second 6 months of therapy vs indefinite therapy (INR=2.0-2.85). After 4 years, their risk of another recurrence was 20% (3/15) with 6 months of therapy vs 5% (1/19) with indefinite therapy. This underpowered study did not show a statistical difference under intention-to-treat analysis; however, the single failure in the treatment group had stopped the warfarin prior to the event.</longtext>

				<sniptext>Limited evidence delineates the relative probabilities of causes of acute diarrhea, typically defined as a diarrheal disease lasting 14 days or fewer, in the developed world. Viruses (rotavirus, Norwalk, and other enteric viruses) are responsible for most cases. Stool culture helps to identify bacterial causes (Salmonella, Shigella, enterotoxic Escherichia coli), especially in patients with fever and bloody stool. A modified 3-day rule (eg, performing only Clostridium difficile toxin tests on low-risk patients who have been hospitalized for 3 or more days) leads to a more rational use of stool cultures without missing cases of clinically significant disease.</sniptext>

Individual studies used different insulin dosing schedules and statistical measures. However, overall, combination therapy provided glucose control comparable with insulin alone. In only 1 small, low-quality study did insulin plus metformin reduce HbA1c more than other combination therapy regimens or insulin alone.

			<snip id="1">
				<sniptext>No, it&apos;s not. No studies demonstrate that training patients to examine their skin decreases mortality from melanoma in the general population. Nor is there any evidence to suggest that teaching patients to monitor their skin for suspicious lesions results in earlier detection of melanoma, better prognosis at diagnosis, or better clinical outcomes. However, patients who have had melanoma and perform self-examination have a lower risk of death from subsequent occurrences than those who do not.</sniptext>

Patients with a history of melanoma who practiced SSE had lower mortality (odds ratio [OR]=0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.85) than those who didn&apos;t. One potential weakness of the study was possible lead-time bias, which could overestimate the risk reduction from SSE.

But at the final assessment (63 days), only the 400-mg dose maintained a statistically significant increase in prealbumin over placebo. However, there was no significant improvement in serum albumin or clinical endpoints (weight, functional status, or health-related quality of life).</longtext>

In 1990 and 1992, follow-up questionnaires asked the subjects if they had been diagnosed with diverticular disease in the interim, and whether they had symptoms of diverticulitis. The study showed a strong inverse relationship between fruit and vegetable fiber intake and risk of symptomatic diverticular disease. It also demonstrated a direct relationship between fat intake, particularly red meat, and symptomatic diverticular disease. For men in the highest quintile of total fat intake and lowest quintile of total fiber intake, the relative risk (RR) of diverticular disease was 2.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-3.98) compared with men in the highest quintile of total fiber intake and lowest quintile of total fat intake. Men in the highest group of red meat intake and lowest quintile of fiber intake had a RR of 3.22 (95% CI, 1.46-7.54) compared with men with the lowest red meat intake and highest dietary fiber intake.

					<longtext>Nine symptoms (cough, dyspnea, sputum production, subjective fever, chills, night sweats, myalgias, sore throat, and rhinorrhea) and 3 items in the past medical history (asthma, immunosuppression, and dementia) were associated with pneumonia. For most elements of history, both the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-) were in the indeterminate range of 0.5 to 2.0. No single feature was sufficient to either rule in or rule out the diagnosis. In one study, the absence of any vital sign abnormalities reduced the likelihood of pneumonia substantially (LR- = 0.18), but did not rule out the diagnosis completely. Egophony had an LR+ of 5.3. Other physical findings (rhonchi, crackles, decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, and bronchial breath sounds) yielded LR+s from 1.5 to 3.5, respectively. Most individual findings were insufficient to diagnose pneumonia. For example, if the baseline prevalence of pneumonia was 5%, the presence of crackles raised the probability to 10% and their absence decreased the probability to 3%.</longtext>

				<sniptext>Colposcopy is the preferred test in the work-up of patients with abnormal cervical cytology: Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL): mild dysplasia. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL): moderate to severe dysplasia. Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) with high-risk human papillo-mavirus (HPV) DNA.

This low specificity means that more than half of women with no cervical pathology will have an abnormal colposcopy result. The corresponding positive and negative likelihood ratios are 2 and 0.1, respectively.
